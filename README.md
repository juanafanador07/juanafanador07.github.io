# Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio. While the design takes inspiration from [midudev's portfolio example](https://github.com/midudev/porfolio.dev), all the code has been written by me.

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command              | Action                                           |
| :------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`       | Installs dependencies                            |
| `pnpm run dev`       | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `pnpm run build`     | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `pnpm run preview`   | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `pnpm run astro ...` | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
